                <h2>New York</h2>
                <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">New York city is one of my favourite place i visited and most of the international visitors. Starting from the Times Square,Empire State Building, to Rockefeller Plaza, the Chrysler Building, Central Park, The High Line 5th Avenue and
                    Broadway.The morning and evening time both look amazing in different views especially the Times Square. We won't get bored even if we visit each day.When you need some respite from the city's busy street life and soaring skyscrapers,
                    retreat to scenic Central Park or the artsy High Line.</p>
