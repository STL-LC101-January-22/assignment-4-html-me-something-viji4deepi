                <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">The Northern Lights have become a sensation for tourists traveling in the Northern Hemisphere. The Northern Lights are auroras, or naturally occurring phenomena that consist of mystifying displays of light in the sky. The northern lights
                    dance across the sky and emanate a diffused glow along the northern horizon.</p>

                <h2>The Grand Canyon </h2>
                <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">You only need to stand on the rim of the Grand Canyon once to know why it's one of the 7 natural wonders of the natural world. The Grand Canyon's massive and colorful landscape provides breathtaking views that can't be found anywhere else
                    in the world.Located in Arizona, Grand Canyon National Park encompasses 277 miles (446 km) of the Colorado River and adjacent uplands. The immense Grand Canyon is a mile (1.6 km) deep, and up to 18 miles (29 km) wide. Layered bands
                    of colorful rock reveal millions of years of geologic history with unmatched vistas from the rim. The South Rim is open 24 hours.

                <h2>Mount Everest </h2>
                <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Mount Everest has an approximate elevation of 29,029 feet. Mountaineers consider this mountain the highest spot on Earth; however, it is not the tallest mountain in the world, a title that belongs to Mauna Kea in Hawaii. Everest lies within
                    the Himalayan mountain range on the border of Nepal and Tibet, China.Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast
                    in Nepal (known as the "standard route") and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind,
                    as well as significant hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall. As of 2019, over 300 people have died on Everest,[4] many of whose bodies remain on the mountain.[5] The first recorded efforts to reach Everest's summit were made
                    by British mountaineers. As Nepal did not allow foreigners to enter the country at the time, the British made several attempts on the north ridge route from the Tibetan side. After the first reconnaissance expedition by the British
                    in 1921 reached 7,000 m (22,970 ft) on the North Col, the 1922 expedition pushed the north ridge route up to 8,320 m (27,300 ft), marking the first time a human had climbed above 8,000 m (26,247 ft). The 1924 expedition resulted in
                    one of the greatest mysteries on Everest to this day: George Mallory and Andrew Irvine made a final summit attempt on 8 June but never returned, sparking debate as to whether or not they were the first to reach the top. Tenzing Norgay
                    and Edmund Hillary made the first official ascent of Everest in 1953, using the southeast ridge route. Norgay had reached 8,595 m (28,199 ft) the previous year as a member of the 1952 Swiss expedition.</p>
